\details The UX namespace provides a library of user interface controls.
Each of the user interface components derives from the Element base class.
The creation and invocation of them is exactly the same as creating 
other types of document entities. For example, to create a 
textbox, it is:

\snippet examples.cpp ux_text
*/
namespace UX {

/**
\addtogroup UXcontrols UX Interface Controls

The UX Interface Controls provides a library of standard 
editing components. Common controls that are available to the w3c
web browser are supported in addition to a few more advanced
controls such as accordion and menu.
